5. Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of each question and confidence level for solving similar problems in the future:  

A:
    Problem 1: Medium – Gained strong understanding of inheritance and feel confident solving similar problems.  
    Problem 2: Medium – Overriding and movement logic were initially challenging but are now clear.  
    Problem 3: High – Abstract classes and calculations required attention but I feel well-prepared for similar problems.  
    Problem 4: High – Implementing interfaces and scaling logic was challenging but I now feel confident in my approach.
